# How the Rounds Went Down

A visual analysis of how Portland's first foray into ranked choice voting went, round by round.

## Data Stuff

All the data from Portland's November 5, 2024 general election can be found on the Multnomah County Elections [Multnomah Votes](https://rcvresults.multco.us/) page. For this piece I specifically used the [final results for the Portland Mayoral race](https://mcdcselectionsrcvprdst.z5.web.core.windows.net/a18a5db1-04a2-4123-8ccb-de12b485f135_City%20of%20Portland%20Mayor/2024-12-02_15-05-02_report_official.html).

## Dev Stuff

This site uses the [svelte template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) made available by [The Pudding](http://pudding.cool). I've updated some of the elements to use runes in svelte v5. It also uses some elements [borrowed from layercake](https://github.com/mhkeller/layercake), also updated to use runes. It's very messy in there, but it's a start.
